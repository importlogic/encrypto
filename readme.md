This project is based on steganography. A process used to hide data and secret messages into an image to conceal information. It uses an algorithm to store the message in binary form along with the RGB values of the image, while changes those values minimally so that the original image does not change.

**ToDo**

 - Add a new feature for AES-256 encryption using shared key so that we can store the hashed message inside the image and not the original message.
